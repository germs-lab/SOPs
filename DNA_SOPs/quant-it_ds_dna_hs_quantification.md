## Procedures:   
### Preparation    
#### Days before you do the quantification:    
- [ ] 1. Make sure that you have enough 96-well black plates.  
    + One column of each plate will be used for DNA concentration standards.   
    + If you have 1 96-well full of DNA samples, you will need to use 2 96-well plates for quantification.   
- [ ] 2. Make sure you have enough of 10XL VWR tips.   
- [ ] 3. Decide your quantification plate layout.  
    + ie., which column of your DNA samples would be moved to plate 2 to be quantified.   
- [ ] 4. Contact Mingfeng Cao <mfcao@iastate.edu> to make sure that we can use their fluorescent plate reader on a particular day and time.   
    + The reading only takes ~ 5 min per plate. But the machine is shared by many labs. Make sure we don't introduce conflicts.   
    + They have both visible light plate reader and fluorescent plate reader. Make sure you are using the fluorescent one.   

#### 30 min - 1 hr before you do the quantification:   
- [ ] 1. Bring the **Quant-iT dsDNA HS buffer (Component B)** to room temperature.   
    + Located in the fridge in the lab (in the Quant-iT dsDNA HS kit box)   
    + Protect from the light (put it in one of the drawers)   
- [ ] 2. Locate the **Quant-iT dsDNA HS reagent (Component A)**.   
    + The fluorescent dye will freeze at 4ºC. Therefore, it's kept at room temperature to avoid freeze and thaw.   
    + In the **Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit** box in the drawer labeled **DNA quantification** under the Qubit.   
    + There are two fluorescent dyes. Make sure take the one says **for 96 well** on it.   
    + Put it in the same drawer where you put the buffer in **Step 1**, also protect from light.   
- [ ] 3. Thaw your DNA samples.  
    + Once it's thaw, give it a quick vortex to mix.  
    + Spin all of the liquid to the bottom of the plate using the plate spinner.   

### Detailed steps:   
**NOTE:**    
**The final volume of each well will be different. For all sample wells, each well will end up with 202µl. For standard wells, each well will end up with 210µl. I called Thermo-Fisher, they said that the assay is designed to be this way (instead of equal volume). They also said that their results show no difference between different volumes and equal volumes.** 

- [ ] 1. Wipe the bench top clean with 70% ethanol (EtOH).   
- [ ] 2. Prepare the working solution in a 50ml sterile tube.   
    + For each sample, working solution consists buffer:dye = 200:1 (ie., 199µl buffer + 1µl dye)   
    + Because we are using medium reservoir and multichannel pipettmen, make sure you mix some extra.  
        + I usually prpare the working solution for 100 samples for 1 96 well plate.   
        + ie., for one plate, I will need:   
            + 100 X 199µl buffer = 19ml and 900µl of buffer    
            + 100 X 1µl dye = 100µl of dye   
- [ ] 3. Bring the DNA standards out of the fridge.  
    + In the Quant-iT dsDNA HS kit box (8 screw cap tubes of them)   
- [ ] 4. Read the label to arrange them in order      
- [ ] 5. Tap each tube to mix    
- [ ] 6. Do a quick spin to make sure all of the liquid falls to the bottom of each tube   
    + This also helps to prevent contamination    
- [ ] 7. Arrange the standards in order in a tube holder.  
    + Put the tubes next to each other leave without space.   
    + Arrange them from 0 - 10ng/µl    
- [ ] 8. Take a black plate. Put the lid aside if there is one.   
- [ ] 9. Label the side body of the black 96-well plate **plate 1**.   
    + Use a silver Sharpie     
- [ ] 10. Pour the working solution from **Step 1** into a medium reservoir.   
- [ ] 11. Use the E1-cliptip 8 channel multipipetteman add 200µl of working solution into each well.  
    + Use program `Htp-repeat200µl`   
    + This program repeatly dispense 200µl for 6 times (has a pre-step)     
    + Use 8 1250µl cliptips      
- [ ] 12. Refer to your layout, to the column designed to standards, add 10µl of each DNA standard.  
    + Uncap your DNA standard tubes  
    + Used the Adjustable Spacing E1-Cliptip 8 Channel multipepetteman   
    + Use 8 1250µl cliptips  
- [ ] 13. Lay a piece of Kim-wipe on the bench top.  
- [ ] 14. Carefully take off your plate sealer. Lay it upside down on the Kim-wipe you just laid down.  
- [ ] 15. Use a VWR manual 8 channel pipetteman (10µl), add 2µl of your DNA samples to the designated wells in **Plate 1**.  
    + Pipette up and down gently to mix.   
    + Depending on your samples, you may need to adjust the volume of your samples.
    + In geeral, 1µl tends to go below detection and 3µl tends to go over detection limits.   
    + Anyway, I find 2µl works very well most of the time. But you still may need to redo some samples afterwards.  
- [ ] 16. Put the black plate lid back on if there is one. Put the plate in an empty drawer to protect it from light.  
- [ ] 17. Put your sample DNA plate back into the -80ºC freezer.    
- [ ] 18. Repeat **Step 8** to **Step 17** for more plates of samples.   
- [ ] 19. Once all samples are done, stack them together and cover with foil.  
- [ ] 20. Bring a flash drive. Carry over to the fluorescent plate reader.   
    + Be careful. Don't spill!   
- [ ] 21. Do the end-point reading using an existing template.   
    + Protocol fluorescent settings:    
        + excitation maxima: ~502 nm
        + emission maxima: ~523 nm    
    + Settings on the fluorescent plate reader we are using:  
        + excitation: 485/20 nm    
        + emission: 516/20 nm  
- [ ] 22. Export the readings and save it to your flash drive.   
- [ ] 23. Clean up:  
    - [ ] Put the **Quant-iT buffer (component B)** back into the fridge.   
    - [ ] Put the **Quant-iT reagent (component A)** back into the labeled foil and into the drawer under Qubit.   
    - [ ] Throw away the black plates.   
    - [ ] Wipe the bench top clean with 70% ethanol.   
    - [ ] Wipe the pipettemen clean with 70% ethanol.
