## Objectives
Quantify a gene within DNA or RNA using quantitative real-time PCR

## Materials
1. qPCR master mix (SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR® Green Supermix)
2. Forward and reverse primers for gene of interest
3. Standard for gene of interest compatible with the primers
4. Molecular grade water
5. 96-well plate (use a plate specifically for qPCR, others do not work)
6. Plate seal (use a plate seal specifically for qPCR, others do not work)
7. Pipets
8. Pipet tips, filtered preferable with DNA, required with RNA
9. 70% ethanol for cleaning

## Procedures
### Clean work area
1. Wipe your work area with 70% ethanol. qPCR is VERY sensitive. Keep your work area SUPER CLEAN. If you work with RNA, all your work MUST be done in a biosafety cabinet.

### Prepare primers
1. Stock solution: If the primer is still powdered, resuspend it in TE buffer or water to make a 100 µM solution. For example, for 20.91 nmol of powdered primer, add 209.1 µL of TE buffer or water. It is best practice to divide your stock solution into several aliquots to minimize the number of freeze-thaw cycles and contamination risk. The stock solution(s) should be stored at -80°C.

2. Working solution: Make a 1:10 dilution. For example, add 10 µL of stock solution to 90 µL water. The concentration of your primer working solution will be 10 µM. Store leftover working solution at -20°C.

3. Each qPCR reaction will require 1 µL of each primer. If your reaction volume is 20 µL, the final concentration of your primer in the reaction will be 500 nM. Optimal reaction concentrations are considered to be from 250-500 nM.

### Prepare Control / Standard
1. Stock solution: If the standard is still powdered, resuspend it in TE buffer to make a 10 ng/µL solution. For example, for 500 ng of powdered standard, add 50 µL TE buffer. Vortex briefly, then incubate the tube in a 50°C water bath for 20 min. It is best practice to divide your stock solution into several aliquots to minimize the number of freeze-thaw cycles and contamination risk. The stock solution(s) should be stored at -80°C.

2. Working solutions: Make 7 serial dilutions of your standard, each 1:10. Please look up how to perform a serial dilution if you are unsure how to do so. It may take a couple runs to determine the best range of dilutions to use. Using your first dilution as your most concentrated standard is a good place to start.

3. Diluted standard solutions degrade quickly and easily. It is CRITICAL to make a fresh serial dilutions from frozen stock each day and keep the dilutions cold between uses. Minimize the number of freeze-thaw cycles for your stock solution.

### Prepare sample
1. Determine the concentration of the samples, for example, using [Quant-iT](https://github.com/germs-lab/SOPs/blob/master/DNA_SOPs/Quant-iT_dsDNA_Assay.md). Preferred sample concentrations are between 500 ng - 50 pg. The final concentration in the reaction will be 50 ng - 5 pg.

### Prepare mix
* Master Mix : 10 µL
* Water: 6 µL
* F Primer: 1 µL
* R Primer: 1 µL
* Sample : 2 µL
* Total : 20 µL

1. Make mix

| ingredients | full plate | half plate |
| :--------- | --------- | ---------: |  
| Master Mix | 1000 µL | 500 µL |
| Water | 600 µL | 300 µL |
| F Primer | 100 µL | 50 µL |
| R Primer | 100 µL | 50 µL |

2. Load mix into plate, 18 µL each well
3. Add standard and samples into plate, 2 µL each well. Each standard and sample should be added in triplicate.
4. Seal tightly to prevent evaporation.
5. Spin briefly to ensure all liquid is at the bottom of the well and there are no bubbles. Spin again if this is not the case.

### Run
1. Load plate on to the machine
2. Start software
3. Choose protocol set temperature
4. Choose plate
5. Start run

### Clean up
1. Store leftover reagents at appropriate temperatures
2. Clean work area
3. Wipe with 70% ethanol 

### Analyze 
Standard curve, efficiency, etc.
