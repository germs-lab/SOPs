# MagAttract Robot setup
* This SOP is for setting up the robot specifically for MagAttract DNA extraction kits in water (27800-4-EP) and soil (27100-4-EP) samples.
* A single run of 96-well plate of DNA extraction requires:
    * 5-6 hours
    * 12 epT.I.P.S. boxes (cat. no. 0030014510, not included in the purchased kit)

## Procedure
1. Thaw **MO BIO 2 ml DWP** containing the supernatant from previous step in a tub of water. 
2.	While samples are being thawed, put your name on a signup sheet next to the computer.
3.	Turn on the computer and the robot, sequentially. Ensure that they are connected at the connection icon on the lower right of desktop. 
4.	Start “epBlue Client” with Username: Pal and Password: pal
5.	Go to “open application”, choose folder “MagAttract”, then choose “PowerMag_Soil_Final.dws”
6.	Place respective items in the positions. See [Robot visual guideline](https://github.com/germs-lab/SOPs/blob/15d56434b2e9154ee52c5044d95cfb32b4366350/images/Robot%20visual%20guideline.pdf) to help with the setup.
    1. **A2, A3, B1, B2, B3**: 5 epT.I.P.S. boxes
    2. **B0**: a waste 400 ml reservoir for liquid waste (located by the sink)
    3. **Waste** (lower left corner): a tip waste bucket for tips waste (located by the sink)
    4. **C2**: add 174 ml of **ClearMag Wash Solution** into an Eppendorf 400 ml reservoir
    5. **C3-3** (the 3rd column counting from the left of tub holder): add 11 ml of **EB or RNase-free water** into an Eppendorf 30 ml reservoir, with the cover on. Important, cover needs to be removed at 2nd tip refill.
    6. **C4**: MoBio Greiner MTP (96-well microplate for final DNA products), with the cover on. **Important, cover needs to be removed at 2nd tip refill**.
    7. **C3-1** (the 1st column counting from the left of tub holder): vortex **ClearMag Zorb Reagent** until beads are resuspended. Add 2 ml ClearMag Zorb Reagent into 85 ml of **ClearMag Binding solution** in a mixing vessel. Vortex well to mix.
        * Add 42.5 ml ClearMag Binding solution into two 50 ml centrifuge tubes and add 1 ml ClearMag Zorb Reagent into each tube.
        * Transfer the entire volume of ClearMag Binding Solution/ClearMag Zorb Reagent into an Eppendorf 100 ml reservoir 
    8. TMX (top right corner): MO BIO 2 ml DWP containing thawed samples
    - [x] Double check to ensure every item is placed correctly.
7. Click run.
8. Number of sample = 96
9. Fill the volume fields:
    1. Mobio 2 ml Greiner DWP – 1530 ul
    2. Wash (if asked) – 174000 ul
    3. Bead/Bind – 87000 ul
    4. Elution buffer – 11000 ul
10. The robot will perform scanning at the beginning of the run and tip refills, it will detect covers on C3-3 and C4 as well as not enough tips for the entire process. Ignore buttons should be selected to notify the robot that you are aware of it in order to proceed further steps.
11. During the run: tip refills need to be performed twice, preferably during incubation times to avoid interrupting the arm movement:
    1. 1st tip refill:  5 boxes around 2 hr 40 mins after starting the run
    2. 2nd tip refill: 2 boxes in position A2 and A3 around 2 hr and 5 mins after the 1st tip refill
    3. Check the robot occasionally between the tip refill and discard liquid and tip waste to avoid overflowing of waste containers
12. At the end of the run: seal DNA plate with a Titer-Tops microplate seal and store at -80oC. 
13. Turn off the program and the robot. 
14. Clean up accordingly.
