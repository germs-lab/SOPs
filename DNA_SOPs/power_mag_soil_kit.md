## Procedures

1. Carefully peel off the Square Well Mat that covers the PowerMag® Bead Plate and set aside. Add 0.25 grams of soil sample to each well of the PowerMag® Bead Plate.
note.  This is an appropriate stopping point. You can store the PowerMag® Bead Plate at 4°C covered with the Square Well Mat.

2. Mix 400 μl of the RNase A Solution to 75 ml of the PowerMag® Bead Solution. Add 750 μl of PowerMag® Bead Solution / RNase A Solution to each well of the PowerMag® Bead Plate.

3. Check the PowerMag® Lysis Solution before using. If the PowerMag® Lysis Solution has precipitated, heat the solution at 60°C until the precipitate has dissolved. Mix gently.
Note.

4. Add 60 μl of PowerMag® Lysis Solution to each well. Secure the Square
Well Mat (from step 1) tightly to the PowerMag® Bead Plate.

5. Place each of the PowerMag® Bead Plates (with Square Well Mats securely af xed) between 2 adapter plates (MO BIO Catalog# 11990) and place on the 96 Well Plate Shaker (MO BIO Catalog# 11996). Reference the protocol provided with the adapter plates for proper placement. Shake at speed 20 for 10 minutes.

6. After the  rst 10 minute cycle, remove the block and rotate it so that the side closest to the machine body is now furthest from the machine. Shake again at speed 20 for 10 more minutes.

7. Centrifuge the PowerMag® Bead Plate at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g.

8. Carefully and without splashing remove and discard the Square Well Mat and transfer the supernatant to a clean PowerMag® 1 ml Collection Plate.

9. Add 450 μl of PowerMag® IRT Solution to each well and apply Sealing Tape to the PowerMag 1 ml Collection Plate. Vortex horizontally for 5 seconds on the vortex ensuring that the solution is well mixed. Incubate at 4°C for 10 minutes. Centrifuge the PowerMag® 1 ml Collection Plate at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g. Remove and discard Sealing Tape.

10. Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume (approximately 850 μl) of supernatant to a new PowerMag® 1 ml Collection Plate. For the wells at the center of the plate, it may help to mark a line on the pipet tip to show how far to insert the tip without touching the pellet. Apply Sealing Tape to the PowerMag® 1 ml Collection Plate. Centrifuge again at 4500 x g for 6 minutes to clear any residual IRT pellet that may have carried over.

11.  Taking care to avoid any residual pellet, transfer no more than 450 μl of supernatant from each well to the wells of a clean Deep Well 96 Plate (DWP). If you wish to use the remaining 400 μl of supernatant left in each well you should transfer them to another DWP and store at 4C until they can be processed on the WeLLevator.
Note: Any prepared lysates at this point that cannot be processed immediately on the robot should be transferred to and stored in clean DWPs at 4C.

12. For each plate to be processed, resuspend the stock of ClearMag® Beads by vortexing the bottle at high speed for at least 30 seconds. Combine 2 ml of ClearMag® Beads with 45 ml of ClearMag® Binding Solution in an appropriate vessel (user provided) and mix well by swirling or end-over-end mixing of the closed vessel. If you are using a multichannel pipettor for reagent dispensing steps, transfer the ClearMag® Bead/Bind dispersion to a multi-channel reservoir.
Note: As time progresses the ClearMag® Beads will slowly settle. Maintain the beads in suspension by frequent mixing for uniform distribution to each well in the next step.

13. Mix the bead dispersion thoroughly and add 470 μl of the ClearMag® Bead/Bind dispersion to each well of the DWP containing lysate. (20 μl of ClearMag® Beads + 450 μl of ClearMag® Binding Solution/well.)
Note: If you are using digital pipettor with ‘dispense and mix’ capabilities, such as the Eppendorf Xplorer, you can use this function to mix your samples after addition of the ClearMag® Bead/Bind dispersion. We recommend mixing your samples 10 times upon ClearMag® Bead/Bind addition.

14. Seal the DWP containing the lysate/ClearMag® dispersion with an appropriate plate seal (user provided) and place the DWP on a vortex equipped with a DWP adapter. Starting with the vortex on the lowest speed setting, slowly increase the power dial until the lysate/ClearMag® dispersion is being homogeneously mixed in all of the wells (but not so fast that it leads to splashing of the dispersion up onto the plate seal). Allow the samples to mix for 10 minutes.
Note: The speed required for efficient mixing will depend on the number of samples you have in your plate, so it is best to start with the vortex at the lowest setting and progress gradually to faster settings. Follow this guideline for all mixing steps on the vortex.

15. Place the PowerMag Magnet (or equivalent) on the WeLLevatorTM and secure the magnet in place with the Spring Steel Clip.
Note: If you are a first-time user of the WeLLevatorTM Pipette Guide, please consult the WeLLevatorTM protocol to familiarize yourself with the device parts and method of operation.

16. Remove the DWP from the vortex adapter and then remove the DWP disposable plate seal. Place the DWP on the WeLLevatorTM equipped with a PowerMag Magnet(or equivalent). Keep the DWP in place for 5 minutes to allow for complete collection of the ClearMag® Beads on the bottom of each well.

17. Keeping the DWP on the magnet, load your multichannel pipettor (8 or 12 channel) with tips and follow the steps outlined in the WeLLevatorTM protocol to align the pipette tips with wells containing sample.

18. Slowly raise the WeLLevatorTM Adjustment Table to a height that brings the pipette tips close to the bottom of the DWP wells without having them physically touch. When the desired height is achieved, tighten the WeLLevatorTM Adjustment Knob to secure the location of the Adjustment Table. Record the height of the Adjustment Table using the scale to the left of the Adjustment Knob: ____. This is the table height that is required when the plate magnet is in place on the WeLLevatorTM.

19. With the DWP still on the magnet, use your multichannel pipettor to aspirate 900 μl of liquid from each well containing sample. Discard the aspirated fluid.

20. Remove the DWP from the plate magnet and add 500 μl of ClearMag® Wash Solution to each well containing sample. Mix the sample by repeated pipetting (5 – 10 times) to completely resuspend the ClearMag® Beads.

21. Seal the DWP containing the lysate/ClearMag® dispersion with an appropriate plate seal (user provided) and place the DWP on a vortex equipped with a DWP adapter. Mix for 5 minutes.

22. Remove the DWP from the vortex adapter and place the DWP on the WeLLevatorTM equipped with the PowerMag Magnet(or equivalent). Keep the DWP in place for 5 minutes to allow for complete collection of the ClearMag® Beads on the bottom of each well.

23. Keeping the DWP on the magnet, remove the DWP disposable plate seal. Load your multichannel pipettor (8 or 12 channel) with tips and aspirate 500 μl of liquid from each sample well. (You may want to set your pipettor to 555 μL in case there is residual fluid volume from previous steps.)

24. Repeat Steps 20 through 23.

25. Remove the DWP from the plate magnet and add 300 μl of ClearMag® Wash Solution to each well containing sample. Mix the sample by repeated pipetting (5 – 10 times) to completely resuspend the ClearMag® Beads and transfer the complete volume of beads to a PowerMag® Microplate (MTP) or equivalent.

26. Place the MTP on the PowerMag Magnet(or equivalent) and keep the MTP in place for 3 minutes to allow for complete concentration of the ClearMag® Beads on the bottom of each well.
Note: You do not need to use the WeLLevator for this step. You can simply place the PowerMag Magneton the benchtop.

27. Keeping the MTP on the magnet, aspirate all of the liquid from each sample well.

28. Remove the MTP from the magnet and elute bound nucleic acids

29. When the ClearMag® Beads are visibly dry, resuspending the beads in each well with 100 μl of ClearMag® Elution Buffer. Seal the MTP plate with a disposable plate seal and place it on a vortex equipped with the DWP adapter. Mix for 5 minutes to ensure that all bead surfaces come in contact with the water.

30. Place the MTP on the PowerMag Magnet(or equivalent) and keep the MTP in place for 3 minutes to allow for complete concentration of the ClearMag® Beads on the bottom of each well.
Note: You do not need to use the WeLLevator for this step. You can simply place the PowerMag Magneton the benchtop.

31. Keeping the MTP on the magnet, remove the Sealing Tape and aspirate the complete volume of eluted nucleic acids, taking care to avoid the concentrated pellet of ClearMag® Beads. Transfer the eluent to a fresh MTP. The eluted DNA is ready for use.

32. If you will not use the eluents right away, seal the plate with an Elution Sealing Mat and store the samples at -20C until needed.
