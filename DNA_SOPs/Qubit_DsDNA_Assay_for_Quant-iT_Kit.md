## Qubit DsDNA Assay for Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit

This protocol is for quantification of extracted DNA using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer and the Invitrogen Quant-IT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Catalog number Q33120).

## Notes

-   Quantification of dsDNA with Qubit is possible using the Quant-iT kit, and is described in the Quant-iT kit User Guide. This protocol is for ease of use.

-   Quant-iT dsDNA HS reagent (orange liquid in 2ml screw cap tube) is light sensitive. It should be brought to room temperature within an opaque container on the bench top. It may also be wrapped in aluminum foil to minimize unnecessary light exposure.

-   After adding Quant-iT dsDNA HS reagent to master mix, the mix and all subsequent tubes with mix are light sensitive. Samples should be quantified immediately after preparation. Samples may also be covered with a sheet of foil during incubation and before quantification.

-   Do not smudge the outside of the qubit tubes

-   Do not read qubit tubes in qubit fluorometer more than once each. Re-reading tubes may generate incorrect values.

## Materials Needed

-   Quant-IT dsDNA Assay Kit, High Sensitivity

-   Qubit assay tubes

-   Vortex

-   Pipette tips and Pipettes

-   (Recommended) Aluminum foil

-   Extracted DNA samples

## Protocol

### 1. Bring all reagents and samples to room temperature before use.

-   Quant-iT kit dsDNA HS reagent should be protected from light, under foil or in an opaque container.

### 2. Make 1:199 dsDNA reagent:buffer solution.

-   Final volume should be calculated as:

(sample number+4)x200ul = final volume

-   For example, if 10 samples are assayed, 2800ul solution should be prepared. (2786ul buffer+14ul reagent)

### 3. Set up standards

-   Pipette 190ul buffer solution into two qubit tubes.

-   To tube 1, add 10ul of the Quant-iT 0ng/ul standard.

-   To tube 2, add 10ul of the Quant-iT 10ng/ul standard.

### 4. Set up samples

-   Determine amount of DNA that will be used for quantification. 2ul-5ul is the recommended volume to use.

-   Use vortex and/or pipette to mix DNA well before transfer to qubit tubes

-   Final volume in the sample tubes should be 200ul. If 2ul DNA will be used, add 198ul buffer solution and 2ul DNA. If 5ul DNA will be used, add 195ul buffer solution and 5ul DNA.

### 5. Vortex all standard and sample tubes for 3-5 seconds.

-   Handle assay tubes with care and do not smudge with the vortex rubber pad

### 6. Incubate all tubes for 2 minutes at room temperature

### 7. Read standards in Qubit fluorometer

-   On Qubit fluorometer, select dsDNA\>\>dsDNA High Sensitivity\>\>Read standards.

-   Insert standard tube 1, read standard. Repeat for standard 2.

### 8. Read samples in Qubit fluorometer

-   On Qubit, select "read samples". Adjust original sample volume to match volume of DNA added in step 4.

-   Select "read tube". Read each sample tube once only.

### 9. Export data

-   On Qubit, select "Data".

-   Insert USB drive into USB drive slot

-   Select "Export".

-   Select Assay run to export

-   Select "Export".

-   Remove USB drive

-   DNA is now quantified and data is ready to use
