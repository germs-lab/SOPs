# DNA extraction using MoBio PowerSoil htp 96 well DNA Extraction Kit      
Author: Fan Yang    


## Objectives   
Obtain total DNA from subsampled samples for downstream molecular analyses, including PCR and sequencing.    

### Materials    
1. Multi-channel pipettemen    
2. Autoclaved pipette tips and barrier pipette tips (various volumes)   
3. Disposable media trays    

### Procedures (mostly folow the kit protocol with some modifications)   
#### Experienced User Centrifugation Protocol    
##### NOTE:
+ Please wear gloves at all times     
+ BEFORE THE FIRST USE ONLY, Solution C5-D must be prepared. Add an equal amount of
100% Ethanol to Solution C5-D (for the 4 prep kit = 120 ml, or for the 12 prep kit = 360 ml).
Mix well. Put a check mark in the “ethanol added” box on the bottle cap label.
+ Use a new sterile disposable medium tray for each solution. If everything was sure kept sterile, pour ecess 
extraction solution back into the bottles.     
+ Centrifugation rotor: S5700.

##### Detailed Steps (tip counts are for one 96 well plate):    
- [ ] 1. Thaw your pre-filled PowerSoil-htp 96 well plate.   
- [ ] 2. Lift the square well mat from pre-filled PowerSoil-htp 96 well plate. Save the mat and lay it upside down on a clean kim-wipe.
    + you can put a kim-wipe on top of the mat to keep dusts or other things to fall on it.     
- [ ] 3. Add 750 µl of PowerSoil
-htp Bead Solution to the wells of the PowerSoil
-htp Bead Plate.   
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-750`     
    + hover tips over the wells, do not touch. use 8 tips.        
- [ ] 4. Check Solution C1. If Solution C1 has precipitated, heat solution at 60ºC until the precipitate has
dissolved.
    + solution C1 contains SDS. If it gets cold, it will precipitate. Heating at 60ºC will dissolve the
SDS. Solution C1 can be used while it is still warm.     
- [ ] 5. Add 60 µl of Solution C1. Secure the Square Well Mat tightly to the plate.     
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat60µl`    
    + this program will dispense 12X 60µl repeatly with a pre-dispense before the first 60µl.      
    + hover tips over the wells, do not touch. use 8 tips.   
- [ ] 6. Place Bead Plate with mat securely fastened between 2 metal shaker adapter plates (MO BIO Catalog# 11990)
<p align="center">

</p>
Reference the protocol provided with the adapter plates for proper placement.       
- [ ] 7. Shake at speed 20 for 10 minutes    
    + use program 2 on the Plate Shaker      
- [ ] 8. Re-orient plates so that the side closest to the
machine body is now furthest from the machine body and shake again at speed 20 for 10 minutes.      
    + use program 2 on the Plate Shaker      
- [ ] 9. Centrifuge at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).    
- [ ] 10. While waiting for the samples to come out of the centrifuge, take a clean 1ml Collection Plate, add 250 µl of Solution C2.     
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat250µl`     
    + this program will repeatly pipette 4X 250µl with a pre-dispense step.     
- [ ] 11. When step 9 is done, remove and discard the Square Well Mat.    
- [ ] 12. Transfer the supernatant (~700µl) to the C2 filled 1 ml Collection Plate from step 10.    
    + use 8 channel 300µl multichannel pipetteman. 
    + Transfer 175µl at a time, total 4 times. Use the tip ledges as guide. The fourth transfer can be done like shown below

</p>
    + Pipette up and down to mix during the 4th transfer.     
    + The supernatant may still contain some soil particles.  
    + change pipette tips between columns. use 96 tips.        
- [ ] 13. Apply **Sealing Tape**.    
- [ ] 14. Incubate at 4ºC for 10 minutes.    
- [ ] 15. Centrifuge the plate at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).  
- [ ] 16. Remove and discard **Sealing Tape**.

    + Pipette up and down to mix during the 4th transfer.   
    + change tips between columns. use 96 tips.           
    + It is safe to stop the protocol at this step and store the samples covered with
a **Foil Sealing Tape** (not supplied in the kit) at 4°C.     
- [ ] 30. Place Spin Plate onto a new 0.5 ml Collection Plate.     
- [ ] 31. Pipet samples from step 29 “up and down” to mix. Load 650 µl into each well of the Spin Plate and apply **Centrifuge Tape**.     
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-mix650µl`     
    + this program will mix the solution by pipetting up and down 3 times. Then uptake 650µl.    
    + do not dip the pipette tip all the way in. The wells will overflow.    
    + change tips for each well. use a total of 3X 96 tips.    
- [ ] 32. Centrifuge at room temperature for 3 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).   
- [ ] 33. Discard the flow through and place the
Spin Plate back on the **same** 0.5 ml Collection Plate. Discard the **Centrifuge Tape**.    
    + dump flow through directly down the sink or in a tray temporarily.     
    + I usually tap the collection plate on kim-wipes/paper towels to get rid of axcess liquid before putting the Spin Plate back on.     
- [ ] 34. Repeat steps 31-33 until all the supernatant has been processed. Discard the final flow through.    
- [ ] 35. Place the Spin Plate back on the **same** 0.5 ml Collection Plate.   
- [ ] 36. Confirm that ethanol has been added to Solution C5-D (see note).   
- [ ] 37. Add 500 µl of Solution C5-D
to each well of the Spin Plate.      
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat500µl`    
    + this program will repeatly pipette 2X 500µl with a pre-dispension step.         
    + hover over, do not touch the wells. use 8 tips.    
- [ ] 38. Apply **Centrifuge Tape** to the Spin Plate.   
- [ ] 39. Centrifuge at room temperature for 3 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).    
- [ ] 40. Discard the flow through and place the
**same** 0.5 ml Collection Plate beneath the Spin Plate.     
- [ ] 41. Centrifuge again at room temperature for 5 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).   
- [ ] 42. Carefully place the Spin Plate onto a Microplate.    
- [ ] 43. Remove **Centrifuge Tape** and discard.     
- [ ] 44. Allow to air dry for 10 minutes at room temperature.     
    + lay a kim-wipe on top of the Spin Plate to prevent dusts from falling into wells.     
- [ ] 45. Add 100 µl of Solution C6 to the center of each well of the Spin Plate. Apply **Centrifuge Tape**.     
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat100µl`    
    + this program will repeatly pipette 12X 100µl with a pre-dispension step.    
    + aim the tips straight above the wells, do not touch the wells. Use 8 tips.      
- [ ] 46. Let C6 sit in the Spin Plate for 1 min.   
- [ ] 47. Centrifuge at room temperature for 3 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).   
- [ ] 48. Remove Spin Plate and discard.    
- [ ] 49. Cover the wells of Microplate with the **Elution Sealing Mat** provided. DNA is now ready for any      
downstream application.     
    + store DNA at -80ºC.     
    + solution C6 does not contain EDTA.    
- [ ] 50. Clean up!   
    - [ ] Discard used paper towels, kim-wipes, plates, etc.   
    - [ ] Wipe down the bench top using 70% ethanol.   
    - [ ] Open the centrifuge lid and turn it off.   
    - [ ] Refill and autoclave the pipette tips for next person to use.
