## MagAttract PowerSoil DNA EP Kit - ROBOT
* Catalog No. 27100-4-EP

### Things to consider
* A blank sample (250ul DI water) needs to be included in each plate of DNA extraction
* To avoid any biases, arrange samples in the extraction plate **randomly**, the layout needs to be recorded in metadata
* The entire protocol can be devided into 3 parts:
    * **Days 0**: subsampling 0.25 grams soil sample into Powerbead plate. This step may takes several days according to your sampling days.
    * **Day 1**: manual extraction, 2 plates of 96-well plate can be extracted together in one day and may require up to 6-8 hours (this SOP).
    * **Day 2**: robot run, 1 plate of 96-well plate require 5-6 hours.

### Day 0
1. Carefully peel off the Square Well Mat that covers the Powerbead Plate and set aside. 
2. Add 0.25 grams of soil sample to each well of the Powerbead Plate. 
    *	This is an appropriate stopping point. You can store the Plate at -80oC covered with the Square Well Mat.

### Day 1
### Before Starting
*	Warm `Solution SL` at 60oC water bath if it has precipitated. Mix gently. Solution SL can be used while it is warm.
*	Add 400ul of the RNAse A Solution to 75 ml of the PowerMag Bead Solution for every 96 well plate you plan to process.

### Procedure
1.	Thaw your plate in water around 1.5-2 hours before you want to extract DNA from your plate. 
2.	Mark the Square Well Mat where A1 and H12 wells locates (if it has not done yet). Peel off the Square Well Mat that covers the Plate. 
    *	Put the Square Well Mat inside up and cover it with a clean Kimwipe. Set it aside.
3.	Add 750 μl of `Powerbead / RNase A Solution` to each well of the Powerbead Plate.
    * For each 96-well plate, add 400ul of `RNase A` to 75 ml of `PowerMag Bead Solution`.
4.	Add 60ul of `Solution SL` to each well. Secure the Square Well Mat (from step 1) tightly to the Powerbead Plate.
    *	Make sure the marker on the square well mate match the A1 and H12 location.
5.	Place each of the Powerbead Plates between 2 adapter plates (MO BIO Catalog# 11990) and place on the 96 Well Plate Shaker (MO BIO Catalog# 11996). Reference the protocol provided with the adapter plates for proper placement. Shake at speed 20 for 10 minutes.
    *	Program 2
6.	After the first 10 min cycle, remove the block and rotate it so that the side closest to the machine body is now furthest from the machine. Shake again at speed 20 for 10 more minutes.
7.	Centrifuge the PowerBead DNA Plate at 4500 g for 6 min at room temperature.
    *	Rotor: S5700
    *	RCF:4500g
8.	Carefully and without splashing, remove and discard the Square Well Mat and transfer the supernatant to a clean **1** ml Collection Plate.
    * After you transfer them with multichannal pipette, you may use single tip pipette to add any extra supernatant to the right wells.
9.	Add 450 μl of `Solution IR` to each well and apply Sealing Tape to the 1 ml Collection Plate. Vortex horizontally for 5 seconds on the vortex ensuring that the solution is well mixed. 
    *	Pour 45 ml Solution IR into reservoir and dispense 450ul of solution IR into each well by multichannel pipette.
10. Incubate at 4°C for 10 minutes. 
11. Centrifuge the 1 ml Collection Plate at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g. Remove and discard Sealing Tape.
12. Avoid the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant to a new **1** ml Collection Plate. Apply Sealing Tape. 
    *	Position of stage is around 7 for the plate holder, but it depends on how much pellet there is in wells.  You cannot insert the tips into wells to check whether that position of stage is good as there is only 1 ml capacity of each well; if you do, it will overflow to possibly cross contaminate your samples. Put the pipette on the stage with the tips outside of plate to check the position.
    * Don’t put the tips all the way into wells as it may cause overflowing of your samples. Slowly put your tips down as the supernatant is sucked into tips** 
13. Centrifuge at 4500 g for 6min. Remove and discard Sealing Tape.
12.	Avoiding any residual pellets, transfer no more than 850 ul of supernatant to a **2** ml Collection Plate.
    * Notes same as step 12. Pay attention to the position of stage and tips’ position into wells. These are crucial steps with caution to avoid any cross contamination.
13.	Label well your 2 ml Collection Plate and put it into -80oC freezer for further use.
### Day 2
Follow [MagAttract Robot setup protocol](https://github.com/germs-lab/SOPs/blob/fef614f1888320dab76877186d03215bdfc58ad4/DNA_SOPs/SOP_MagAttract_robot_setup_for_DNA_extraction.md) for Robot use.
