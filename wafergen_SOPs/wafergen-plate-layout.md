1.	 The first and crucial step is to decide how many primer sets or how many samples you will send for wafergen. You have to know at least one of these two for sure, as you have to stick to certain layouts.  Based on the number of assays or the number of your samples, you can choose the best layouts to fit your experiment.  The available layouts are as follows: (eg. If you have 6 targeted gene with duplicates, it makes 12 essays)

Assays | Samples
----- | -----
12 | 384
24 | 216
36 | 144
48 | 108
54 | 96
72 | 72
80 | 64
96 | 54
120 | 42
144 | 36
216 | 24
248 | 20
296 | 16
384 | 12

2.  After you have decided the number of assays and/or the number of samples, contact Christi Harris, who takes charge of wafergen in MSU.fill out the layouts you will use
* The email address is: hemmingc@msu.edu 
* In the layout, there is information of sample volume and volume of each primer set.
* You always can email her with:
    *  A) The estimate time to send her samples and primers: to let her know that there are samples to come to scheudle the run
    *   B) Does she have enough SYBR master mix? if yes, you dont need to send along with your samples; if not, send one pack
    

*   For each layout, the volume of sample and volume of each primer set are different.  Please refer to the layout she sends you based on your experiment. 
*   Use 12 assays X 384 samples layout as an example:
