## MagAttract PowerSoil DNA EP Kit
* Catalog No. 27100-4-EP
* Modified by: lanying Ma
## Before Starting
*	Warm the Solution SL at 60oC water bath if this solution SL has precipitated. Mix gently. Solution SL can be used while it is warm.
*	Add 400ul of the RNAse A Solution to 75 ml of the PowerMag Bead Solution for every 96 well plate you plan to process.
## Protocols:
1.	Carefully peel off the Square Well Mat that covers the Powerbead Plate and set aside. Add 0.25 grams of soil sample to each well of the Powerbead Plate. 
*	This is an appropriate stopping point. You can store the Plate at -80oC covered with the Square Well Mat.
2.	 Thaw your plate in water around 1.5-2 hours before you want to extract DNA from your plate. 
3.	Mark the Square Well Mat where A1 and H12 wells locates (if it has not done yet). Peel off the Square Well Mat that covers the Plate. 
*	Put the Square Well Mat inside up and cover it with a clean Kimwipe. Set it aside.
4.	Add 750 μl of Powerbead / RNase A Solution to each well of the Powerbead Plate.
5.	Add 60ul of Solution SL to each well. Secure the Square Well Mat (from step 1) tightly to the Powerbead Plate.
*	Make sure the marker on the square well mate match the A1 and H12 location.
6.	Place each of the Powerbead Plates between 2 adapter plates (MO BIO Catalog# 11990) and place on the 96 Well Plate Shaker (MO BIO Catalog# 11996). Reference the protocol provided with the adapter plates for proper placement. Shake at speed 20 for 10 minutes.
*	Use program 2 of the Shaker
7.	After the first 10 min cycle, remove the block and rotate it so that the side closest to the machine body is now furthest from the machine. Shake again at speed 20 for 10 more minutes.
8.	Centrifuge the PowerBead DNA Plate at 4500 g for 6 min at room temperature.
*	Rotor: S5700
*	RCF:4500g
9.	Carefully and without splashing, remove and discard the Square Well Mat and transfer the supernatant to a clean **1** ml Collection Plate.
*	Transfer no more than 750 ul supernatant.
10.	Add 450 μl of Solution IR to each well and apply Sealing Tape to the 1 ml Collection Plate. Vortex horizontally for 5 seconds on the vortex ensuring that the solution is well mixed. Incubate at 4°C for 10 minutes. Centrifuge the 1 ml Collection Plate at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g. Remove and discard Sealing Tape.
*	Use the reservoir in the lab. Add 45 ml Solution IR into reservoir and dispense 450ul of solution IR into each well by multichannel pipette.
11.	Avoid the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant to a new **1** ml Collection Plate. Apply Sealing Tape and centrifuge at 4500 g for 6min. Remove and discard Sealing Tape.
*	**Position of stage is around 7 for the plate holder, but it depends on how much pellet there is in wells.  You cannot insert the tips into wells to check whether that position of stage is good as there is only 1 ml capacity of each well; if you do, it will overflow to possibly cross contaminate your samples. Put the pipette on the stage with the tips outside of plate to check the position.
* Don’t put the tips all the way into wells as it may cause overflowing of your samples. Slowly put your tips down as the supernatant is sucked into tips** 

12.	Avoiding any residual pellets, transfer no more than 850 ul of supernatant to a **2** ml Collection Plate.
* Notes are same as step 11. Pay attention to the position of stage and tips’ position into wells.   These are crucial steps with caution to avoid any cross contamination.
13.	Label well your 2 ml Collection Plate and put it into -80oC freezer.
*	The following steps will be done by Robot.  To do following steps, you need to put your 2 ml collection plate in water to thaw. 

The following steps are to set up for Robot:
14.	 Place the 2 ml Collection Plate containing the supernatant on the epMotion robotic deck as indicated in the epMotion program worktable.
*	The upper right corner postion
15.	For each 96 well plate to be processed, add 174 ml of ClearMag Wash Solution in to an Eppendorf 400 ml reservoir placed at the appropriate location on the deck.
*	Position: C2
16.	 For each 96 well plate to be processed, add 11 ml of Solution EB into an Eppendorf 30 ml reservoir placed in an Eppendorf tub holder at the appropriate location 
*	Position: The 3rd column counting from left on the tub holder
17.	 Vortex the bottle containing ClearMag beads (Zorb Reagent) until beads are resuspended. For each 96 well plate, add 2 ml ClearMag beads to 85 ml of ClearMag Binding Solution in a mixing vessel. Vortex well well to mix.
*	Use 50 ml falcon tubes to have 42.5 ml of ClearMag Binding solution with 1 ml ClearMag beads.
18.	Transfer the entire volume of ClearMag Binding Solution/ClearMag beads into an Eppendorf 100 ml reservoir placed in and Eppendorf tub holder located at appropriate location.
*	Position: The 1st column counting from left of tub holder

19.	 Initiate the protocol.
20.	 Turn on the computer and start “epblue client”, then go to “open application” to choose folder “MagAttract”, choose “PowerMag_Soil_Final.dws”
21.	Set up the plate and tips and reagents needed for the run.(There is another protocol in lab to show exactly how it is set up).
22.	Click run.
23.	First time tip change is 2 hr 40mins after it starts running. Second time of tips change is 2 hr and 5 mins after 1st time tip change.
