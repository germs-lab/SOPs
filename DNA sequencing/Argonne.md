# Argonne Amplicon Library Sequencing – Preparation and Submission

## General Submission Requirements

#### Sample sheet
*	Must include Unique sample IDs and DNA concentrations
*	Samples are arranged in rows (A1-A12, B1-B12, etc.)
*	Blank wells are kept at the end of plate and not scattered about or in the middle
*	Blank wells should be identified as blank

#### Amplicon library preparation
*	200-700 samples are recommended for a submission
*	20 uL of volume ranging in concentration from 1-50ng/uL 
*	Samples are submitted in fully-skirted 96-well plates with aluminum foil plate seals

#### Sample submission
*	Email Sarah Owens (sarah.owens@anl.gov) and Stephanie Greenwald (smoormann@mcs.anl.gov) with final number of samples along with the primer set to request for a quote
*	Once the paperwork started, email the completed sample sheet to Sarah and Stephanie
*	Samples need to be sent on dry ice and place cardboard or something rigid between the plates to ensure that the plates don’t break or pierce each other
> **Note:** Shipping with dry ice is catagorized as hazardous shippping, please refer to [hazardous shipping SOP](https://github.com/germs-lab/SOPs/blob/master/HazardousShipping.md) for proper instruction
*	Shipment should be made on Monday or Tuesday to make sure the samples are delivered during business days
*	Ship to:<br/>

## Sample Inbound into GERMS

#### Requirements
*	[Metadata file](https://github.com/germs-lab/SOPs/blob/master/data_management_SOPs/GERMS_Lab_Data_Management_101.md), uploaded on [CyBox](https://iastate.app.box.com/folder/71875390050)
*	DNA samples (20 uL of volume ranging in concentration from 1-50ng/uL)

#### Submit your samples to GERMS
*	Contact Adina and JiJY to confirm number of samples
*	JiJY create sample sheet for Argonne submission and identify sample location (plate and well numbers)
> **Note:** Samples are arranged in rows (A1-A12, B1-B12, etc.)
*	Collaborators fill Sample IDs, DNA concentrations (and associated metadata, if you want them to be included in the mapping file)
*	Collaborators contact JiJY to communicate about providing samples according to the sample sheet
> **Note:** Samples could be provided in both individual tubes or fully-skirted 96-well plates, depends on total number of samples
