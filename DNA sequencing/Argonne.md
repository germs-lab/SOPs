# Argonne Amplicon library sequencing – Preparation and Submission

## General Submission Requirements

#### Sample sheet
*	Must include Unique sample IDs and DNA concentrations
*	Samples are arranged in rows (A1-A12, B1-B12, etc.)
*	Blank wells are kept at the end of plate and not scattered about or in the middle
*	Blank wells should be identified as blank

#### Amplicon library preparation
*	200-700 samples are recommended for a submission
*	20 uL of volume ranging in concentration from 1-50ng/uL 
*	Samples are submitted in fully-skirted 96-well plates with aluminum foil plate seals

#### Sample submission
*	Email Sarah Owens (sarah.owens@anl.gov) and Stephanie Greenwald (smoormann@mcs.anl.gov) with final number of samples along with the primer set to request a quote
*	Once the paperwork started email the completed sample sheet to Sarah and Stephanie
*	Samples need to be sent on dry ice and place cardboard or something rigid between the plates to ensure that the plates don’t break or pierce each other
*	Shipment should be made on Monday or Tuesday to make sure the samples are delivered during business days

## Sample Inbound into GERMS

#### Requirements
*	Metadata (upload on BOX)
*	DNA samples (20 uL of volume ranging in concentration from 1-50ng/uL)

#### Submit your samples to GERMS
*	Contact Adina and JiJY to confirm number of samples
*	JiJY create sample sheet for Argonne submission and identify sample location (plate and well numbers)
- [ ] Note: samples are arranged in rows (A1-A12, B1-B12, etc.)
*	Collaborators fill Sample ID, DNA concentration (and metadata, if you want them to be included in the mapping file)
*	Collaborators contact JiJY to communicate about providing samples according to the sample sheet
- [ ] Note: Samples could be provided in both individual tubes or fully-skirted 96-well plates, depends on total number of samples
