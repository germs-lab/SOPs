## Objectives
Quantify total DNA. This SOP assume your DNA samples are in the 96-well plate.
Process only one plate to reduce total processing time. Working solution will be degraded contiuasly before adding DNA.

## Materials
1. Qubit dsDNA HS kit

## Procedures
1. Arrange tubes on the rack

2. Thaw your sample

3. Prepare working solution. 1+199 for reagent+buffer. For 96 sample (with 20% extra), 120 ul (reagent) + 23,880 ul (buffer). 

4. Make standard: in 2 tube, 190 ul of working solution + 10 ul of each standard 1 and 2. Voltex.

5. Using multi-pipet(300ul), distribute working solution into clean plate (You neeed to use big-volume plate). 198 ul of working solution into each well.

6. Using multi-pipet(10ul), load 2 ul of sample.

7. Using multi-pipet(300ul), Set pipet 200 ul. Pipet up-and-down 10 times to mix samples. 

8. Using Electonic multi-pipet (length adjustable), move entire volume (200ul) into tubes.

9. Using Qubit florometer, measure DNA concentration with standard.
