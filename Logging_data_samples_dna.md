Anyone who has managed samples or DNA  in our lab, I would like you to fill in this data management sheet as soon as possible [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ljtagOQj49VavnTW4h8ylEd01BkO2mf-GS0HNmWSoXY/edit?usp=sharing].  If you do not have access, email me immediately.

If you have samples in the freezer/fridge w/o DNA extracted:
They should be logged on a freezer sheet log and also Lanying or Leigh Ann should know about these samples and where they are at.

If you have extracted DNA from your samples:
You should be completing this spreadsheet to the best of your ability throughout your experiment. 

1.  The first step is to log where the samples are at in column M of the spreadsheet. 
2.   Write down who has touched samples and DNA and/or downstream analysis at ISU.
3.   Write down information on DNA extraction - which kit (including lot number)
4.   Write down whether it was a manual extraction or on the robot [If you deviated from our default extraction SOPs, you need to make a comment [https://github.com/germs-lab/SOPs/blob/master/mobio_powersoil_htp_96well_dna_extraction.md]*
5.  Write down some information about the environmental matrix (soil, water, manure)
6.  After DNA Quantification, write down the min, max, average, and R squared of the standard curve
7.  Complete what data has been generated for the project and what is planned (wafergen, amplicon)
8.  Write down where the data is stored:  GERMS Public Google Drive:  DNA Quant [GERMS Public --> sequencing --> dsDNA_quantifications], Wafergen Design and Results [GERMS Public --> Wafergen].  Sequencing Results should be stored on HPC and the directory should be listed here.

*Postdocs, please make sure our robot, Wafergen, and DNA quantification protocols are up to date and please email me a confirmation that it is so.   Please add a last revised date on protocols from now on forward.
