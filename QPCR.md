##Objectives
Quantitate DNA/RNA using quantitative real-time PCR

##Materials
1. QPCR master mix kit
2. 96-well plate
3. cap or plate sealer
4. pipet
5. pipet tip / barriered if RNA
6. alcohol for cleaning

##Procedures
###Clean work area
1. Wipe work area with alcohol. QPCR is VERY sensitive. Keep your work area SUPER CLEAN. If you work with RNA, all your work MUST be done in/under Bio-safety cabinet.

###Prepare primer
1. If the primer is fresh purchased, make stock solution: if the primer provided has 20.91 nmol, add 209.1 ul of TE buffer or water: Concentration of stock solution is 100 uM. Save Store stock solution in -80 c 
2. Make working solution: Make 1:10 dilution. For example add 10 ul of stock solution in 90 ul water. Concentration will be 10 uM. Store leftover working solution in -20 c.
3. We will Add 1ul of primer each well. if your reaction volume is 20 ul, so, your final concentration will be 500 nM. FYI, good final concentration is 250-500 nM, so, dilute primer if needed.

###Prepare Control / Standard
1. Ask what is the concentration and copy number.
2. Make 6 of X10 dilution (then total 7 include original). To make serial dilution, take 4 ul of original, mix with 36 ul of water, and repeat. 

###Prepare sample
1. Find concentration of the sample. Preferred Sample concentration would be 500 ng - 50 pg. Then final concentration will be 50 ng - 5 pg.

###Prepare mix
Master Mix : 10 ul
Water: 6 ul
Primer F: 1 ul
Primer R: 1 ul
Sample : 2 ul
total : 20 ul

1. Make mix
| ingredients | full plate | half plate |
| Master Mix | 1000 ul | 500 ul |
| Water | 600 ul | 300 ul |
| Primer F | 100 ul | 50 ul |
| primer R | 100 ul | 50 ul |

2. Then load mix into plate 18ul each
3. Add standard and samples 2 ul each
4. Seal
5. Spin

###Run
1. Load plate on to the machine
2. Start Software
3. Choose protocol set temperature
4. Choose plate
5. Start run

###Clean up
1. Store leftover in appropriate temperature
2. Clean work area
3. Wipe with alcohol 

###Analyze 
standard curve, efficiency etc.
