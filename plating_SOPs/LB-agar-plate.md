## Objectives
Make LB agar plate, about 25 plates

## Materials
1. LB broth

2. agarose

3. DI water

4. Glass bottle and stirring bar

5. Weight paper

## Procedures
1. Add 250 mL of DI water and a magnetic stir bar to a glass bottle

2. Weight 12.5g of LB broth to bring into solution

3. Weight 7.5g of agarose to bring into solution

4. Add DI water to total volume of 500 mL. Bottle should be no more than 2/3 full.

5. Put on stirring plate with stirring bar while stirring
  -Note: Some LB clumps will not dissolve until heated in the autoclave. 

6. Autoclave at liquid setting for 20 minutes (program 3)

7. Let agar cool to ~55C

8. Wipe down biosafety cabinet thoroughly with alchohol.

9. In biosafety cabinet, add antibiotics (either 500 ul of Kanamycin or Ampicillin), if needed. 
  - Note: After adding antibiotics, close bottle (to maintain contents sterility), place bottle on stirring plate, stir for 1-2 minutes. 

10. In biosafety cabinet, remove sterile petri dishes from plastic bag

11. Pour LB agar (~20ml) into each plate (open lid up just enough to pour)

12. Let each plate cool until its solid (~10 min)
  -Note: if excessive condensation forms, prop plate lid open slightly and let dry for ~5 min (monitor closely to prevent dehydrating the media)

13. Flip agar plate

14. Store plates in plastic bags in fridge with: name, date and contents

### Stock soilutions
1. Ampicillin or Kanamycin 50 mg in 1 ml of water
