Author: Fan Yang    


## Objectives   
Obtain total DNA from subsampled samples for downstream molecular analyses, including PCR and sequencing.    

### Materials    
1. Multi-channel pipettemen    
2. Autoclaved pipette tips and barrier pipette tips (various volumes)   
3. Disposable media trays    

### Procedures (mostly folow the kit protocol with some modifications)   
#### Experienced User Centrifugation Protocol    
##### NOTE:
+ Please wear gloves at all times     
+ BEFORE THE FIRST USE ONLY, Solution C5-D must be prepared. Add an equal amount of
100% Ethanol to Solution C5-D (for the 4 prep kit = 120 ml, or for the 12 prep kit = 360 ml).
Mix well. Put a check mark in the “ethanol added” box on the bottle cap label.
+ Use a new sterile disposable medium tray for each solution. If everything was sure kept sterile, pour ecess 
extraction solution back into the bottles.     
+ Centrifugation rotor: S5700.    
    ![S5700](/images/rotor_s5700.JPG =20x)     
+ Also make sure the plate adapters sit flat in the rotor bucket before centrifugation.     
    ![plate adapters](/images/plate_adapter.JPG)     
+ Minimal tips need per 96 extraction:    
    + 3 boxes and 7 columns of Clip-tip 1250µl.     
         ![Clip-tip 1250µl](/images/cliptip.JPG)    
    + 5 boxes of 200µl VWR tips.

##### Detailed Steps (tip counts are for one 96 well plate):    
- [ ] 1. Thaw your pre-filled PowerSoil-htp 96 well plate.   
- [ ] 2. Lift the square well mat from pre-filled PowerSoil-htp 96 well plate. Save the mat and lay it upside down on a clean kim-wipe.
    + you can put a kim-wipe on top of the mat to keep dusts or other things to fall on it.     
- [ ] 3. Add 750 µl of PowerSoil
-htp Bead Solution to the wells of the PowerSoil
-htp Bead Plate.   
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-750`     
    + hover tips over the wells, do not touch. use 8 tips.        
- [ ] 4. Check Solution C1. If Solution C1 has precipitated, heat solution at 60ºC until the precipitate has
dissolved.
    + solution C1 contains SDS. If it gets cold, it will precipitate. Heating at 60ºC will dissolve the
SDS. Solution C1 can be used while it is still warm.     
- [ ] 5. Add 60 µl of Solution C1. Secure the Square Well Mat tightly to the plate.     
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat60µl`    
    + this program will dispense 12X 60µl repeatly with a pre-dispense before the first 60µl.      
    + hover tips over the wells, do not touch. use 8 tips.   
- [ ] 6. Place Bead Plate with mat securely fastened between 2 ![adapter plates](/images/96well_plate_shaker_adapter.JPG) (MO BIO Catalog# 11990)
and place on the ![96 Well Plate Shaker](/images/96well_plate_shaker.JPG) (MO BIO Catalog# 11996). Reference the protocol provided
with the adapter plates for proper placement.       
- [ ] 7. Shake at speed 20 for 10 minutes    
    + use program 2 on the Plate Shaker      
- [ ] 8. Re-orient plates so that the side closest to the
machine body is now furthest from the machine body and shake again at speed 20 for 10 minutes.      
    + use program 2 on the Plate Shaker      
- [ ] 9. Centrifuge at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).    
- [ ] 10. While waiting for the samples to come out of the centrifuge, take a clean 1ml Collection Plate, add 250 µl of Solution C2.     
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat250µl`     
    + this program will repeatly pipette 4X 250µl with a pre-dispense step.     
- [ ] 11. When step 9 is done, remove and discard the Square Well Mat.    
- [ ] 12. Transfer the supernatant (~700µl) to the C2 filled 1 ml Collection Plate from step 10.    
    + use 8 channel 300µl multichannel pipetteman. 
    + Transfer 175µl at a time, total 4 times. Use the tip ledges as guide. The fourth transfer can be done like ![this](/images/pipettetip_position_200microl_2.JPG).        
    + Pipette up and down to mix during the 4th transfer.     
    + The supernatant may still contain some soil particles.  
    + change pipette tips between columns. use 96 tips.        
- [ ] 13. Apply **Sealing Tape**.    
- [ ] 14. Incubate at 4ºC for 10 minutes.    
- [ ] 15. Centrifuge the plate at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).   - [ ] 16. Remove and discard **Sealing Tape**.     
- [ ] 17. Avoiding the pellet, transfer ~800µl of supernatant to a new 1 ml Collection Plate.    
    + use 8 channel 300µl multichannel pipetteman.   
    + Transfer 200µl at a time, total 4 times.     
    + change tips between columns. use 96 tips.     
- [ ] 18. Apply **Sealing Tape** to plate.   
- [ ] 19. Centrifuge the plate again at room temperature for 6 minutes at
4500 x g(RCF).   
- [ ] 20. While waiting for step 19 to complete, ta a new 1ml Collection Plate, and add 200 µl of Solution C3.    
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat200µl`     
    + this program will repeatly dispense 6X 200µl with a pre-dispense step.      
- [ ] 21. Once step 19 is done, transfer ~750µl of supernatant to the C3 filled 1 ml Collection Plate from step 20.    
    + use 8 channel 300µl multichannel pipetteman. 
    + Transfer 187.5µl at a time, total 4 times.

    + It is safe to stop the protocol at this step and store the samples covered with
a **Foil Sealing Tape** (not supplied in the kit) at 4°C.     
- [ ] 30. Place Spin Plate onto a new 0.5 ml Collection Plate.     
- [ ] 31. Pipet samples from step 29 “up and down” to mix. Load 650 µl into each well of the Spin Plate and apply **Centrifuge Tape**.     
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-mix650µl`     
    + this program will mix the solution by pipetting up and down 3 times. Then uptake 650µl.    
    + do not dip the pipette tip all the way in. The wells will overflow.    
    + change tips for each well. use a total of 3X 96 tips.    
- [ ] 32. Centrifuge at room temperature for 3 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).   
- [ ] 33. Discard the flow through and place the
Spin Plate back on the **same** 0.5 ml Collection Plate. Discard the **Centrifuge Tape**.    
    + dump flow through directly down the sink or in a tray temporarily.     
    + I usually tap the collection plate on kim-wipes/paper towels to get rid of axcess liquid before putting the Spin Plate back on.     
- [ ] 34. Repeat steps 31-33 until all the supernatant has been processed. Discard the final flow through.    
- [ ] 35. Place the Spin Plate back on the **same** 0.5 ml Collection Plate.   
- [ ] 36. Confirm that ethanol has been added to Solution C5-D (see note).

to each well of the Spin Plate.      
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat500µl`    
    + this program will repeatly pipette 2X 500µl with a pre-dispension step.         
    + hover over, do not touch the wells. use 8 tips.    
- [ ] 38. Apply **Centrifuge Tape** to the Spin Plate.   
- [ ] 39. Centrifuge at room temperature for 3 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).    
- [ ] 40. Discard the flow through and place the
**same** 0.5 ml Collection Plate beneath the Spin Plate.     
- [ ] 41. Centrifuge again at room temperature for 5 minutes at 4500 x g(RCF).   
- [ ] 42. Carefully place the Spin Plate onto a Microplate.    
- [ ] 43. Remove **Centrifuge Tape** and discard.     
- [ ] 44. Allow to air dry for 10 minutes at room temperature.     
    + lay a kim-wipe on top of the Spin Plate to prevent dusts from falling into wells.     
- [ ] 45. Add 100 µl of Solution C6 to the center of each well of the Spin Plate. Apply **Centrifuge Tape**.     
    + use E1 Clip-tip 1250µl, program `Htp-repeat100µl`    
    + this program will repeatly pipette 12X 100µl with a pre-dispension step.    
    + aim the tips straight above the wells, do not touch the wells. Use 8 tips.
