## PowerMag Water DNA isolation protocol
* Catalog No. 27800-4-EP
* Modified by: lanying Ma

## This protocol is based on PowerMag Air & Water DNA isolation kit.
Before starting
*	Warm the PoweMag Lysis Solution at 60oC for 15-20 mins before starting to dissolve any precipitates.
*	You have to have a spreadsheet of your 96 samples ready including UID, Date, Site, PlateLocation, etc.  Thus, we are less likely to make mistakes on which sample in which well later. 


1.	Your samples are already on the filter rolled into cylinder with the top side facing inward in the 5 ml Bead Tube.
*	If the filter is not rolled like cylinder, use alcohol-cleaned forceps to unfold the filter and roll it like cylinder with the top side facing inward. 

2.	Add 1 ml of warmed PowerMag Lysis Solution/RNaseA.
*	For 96 samples, need 100 ml PowerMag lysis Solution and 900 l RNase A. They could be in two 50 ml falcon tubes.  You could add 450 l RNase A into one of the tube and add the solution/RNase to tubes while keeping another 50 ml Lysis Solution in the 60oC water bath to keep warm until you need it; then add RNase A in for further use. 

3.	Place 16 of the 5 ml Bead Tubes into each 5 ml Tube Adapter and place on the 96 Well Plate Shaker.  Two Tube Adapter are available, so 32 samples could be done once. Shake at speed 20 for 5 mins
*	It is the Program 1 in our plate shaker

4.	After the first 5 minute cycle, remove the Tube Adapter assemblies and rotate them so that the side closest to the machine body is now furthest from the machine body. Shake again at speed 20 for 5 more mins. 
*	Use alcohol-cleaned forceps to take the filter out. Rotate the filter and lean it to the inner wall of tubes to get as much liquid as possible in the tubes. 

5.	Centrifuge the 5 ml Bead Tubes at room temperature for 1 min at 4500 X g. 
*	Rotor: S-5.1 with BUC (not PLA)
*	RCF: 4500 X g

6.	Repeat step 3,4 and 5 to finish 96 samples

7.	Transfer the supernatant to a clean MO BIO 2 ml Deep Well Plate (DWP). It will be necessary to push the pipette tip through the beads into the bottom to the bead tube in order to recover as much supernatant as possible.
*	This is crucial step. You have to know which sample is transferred to which well.  Always double check with your spreadsheet and mark them down.

8.  Add 200 ul PowerMag Inhibitor Removal Solution to each well and apply sealing Tape to the MO BIO 2 ml DWP. Vortex horizontally for 5 seconds on the vortex ensuring the solution is well mixed. Incubate at room temperature for 5 mins
*	Use the reservoir in the lab.  Add 20 ml PowerMag Inhibitor Removal Solution to reservoir and then add it to DWP with multichannel pipette.

9.	  Centrifuge the MO BIO 2 ml DWP at room temperature for 6 mins at 4500 X g. Remove and discard Sealing Tape.
*	Rotor: S-5700
*	RCF: 4500 g

10.	  Avoid the pellet, transfer the entire volume of the supernatant to a new Mo BIO 2 ml DWP. Apply Sealing Tape to the DWP. Centrifuge at 4500 g for 6 mins to clear any residual particulates that may have carried over.
*	Position is around 7 for the plate holder. You can insert the pipette and check whether the tip touch the pellets

11.	  Transfer no more than 800 ul of supernatant to a new MO BIO 2 ml DWP again avoiding any residual pellet.
*	Until now, we get the samples ready for Robot. Labe your plate and put it into -80oC for further use.

12.	  Thaw your samples in MO BIO 2 ml DWP in water.
13.	Follow another protocol for Robot use.
