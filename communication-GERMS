This document is some guidance on how to communicate and write collaboratively, specifically with Adina, within the GERMS team.  It should be noted that these comments are for Adina but are written down because I (Adina) truly believe they are important professional development skills for successful project management.

First, a brief glimpse into my day, I typically have 30-min to 2-h tasks or meetings scheduled in any day, meaning that I am trying to manage up to 10 major tasks a day, email, slack, and any spontaneous discussions that come up.  When you send me something, I usually prioritize your needs if I can (because I want to!).  That being said, I expect that when you choose to interact with me, you've THOUGHTFULLY decided that you need me to prioritize your needs also.   Here are some suggestions on the ways to thoughtfully proceed...

### Unscheduled communications (Slack, pop-in office)

Let me emphasize that I am here for you, and I love talking to you generally.  I especially love talking to you when you first ask me "Do you have a minute?  Or, when you have a minute, could I ask a question?"  Based on your experiences, you'll know that I usually do have a moment for you depending on how complex your question is.    

### Scheduled communications (Emails, Weeklys, Anything that I put on my calendar)

These are very important to me.  I consider it a privilage to have our team and to have you on our team. Thus, when we have these times, I try to focus on you or your task.  I also hope that you equally consider the same privilage and take that time to appropriately to communicate to me your needs or your tasks is professionally completed.  Some examples of great ways to so:

* On time weekly summaries with links to anything we have previously discussed (even if you've sent them before).  
* Updates on things I've asked you to do (without me asking), even if they are unfinished.  I like to know you're tracking it, and it really stinks if I think you are not, or worse ignoring it.
* Outlines / Drafts / Papers / Reports - think about where you would like me to contribute my time based on what is challenging you.  For example, it is super when I get papers submitted to me with super organization, so that I can spend my way improving content.  I love it when things are in Box in folders, so that I can easily find them.  A great email is "Adina my paper is ready to read.  You'll find the figures in the Figures folder and Tables in the Tables folder in the box, link is www.box.link.  I've added references in the paper so it's easy for you to find them, but I'll change them as they change."  I love you student.
* Remember, in the end, this journey is about you (and not me!). Whatever product you are producing, it is yours.  Think about professionalism in your communications with me and the team in associated communications on it.
