As members of our team graduate or leave our lab for new opportunities, there if often the opportunity to continue collaborating.  We hope that you will continue to collaborate if opportunities exist!

In a specific case, this collaboration takes the form of publishing the work performed during your time in the lab.  Similar to any other publication on our team, the decision of authorship on *any* publication is at the discretion of the corresponding author.   

It should be agreed upon that authorship and specifically lead authorship requires the responsibilitity of communicating the intellectual work.  For leading authorship, GERMS expectations require the contributions described in this [Credit author statement](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement) and also the following:

* Substantial, direct, intellectual contribution
* Data and samples be organized and accessible prior to departure fromt the lab
* Submission of the manuscript to the journal (unless otherwise agreed upon)
* Responsibility of reponding to reviewers
* Communicating with *all* collaborators the status and needs of the manuscript in a timely manner (which is agreed upon)
