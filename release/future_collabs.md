As members of our team graduate or leave our lab for new opportunities, there if often the opportunity to continue collaborating.  In many cases, this collaboration takes the form of contributing or leading the publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts.  In this case, a conversation about the authorship of these efforts should be discussed to ensure a smooth transition. 

It should be agreed upon that authorship and specifically lead authorship requires the responsibilitity of communicating the intellectual work.  For leading authorship, GERMS expectations require (see also the [Credit author statement](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement) and also the following:

* Substantial, direct, intellectual contribution
* Submission of the manuscript to the journal
* Responsibility of reponding to reviewers
* Communicating with collabortors the status and needs of the manuscript in a timely manner (which is agreed upon)

If these requirements are not able to be met, authorship can be discussed.  Ultimately, the decision of the authorship will be the responsibility of the corresonding author, who should be agreed upon.
