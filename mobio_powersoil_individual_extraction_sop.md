(Modified from standard PowerSoil DNA Isolation Experienced User Protocol)    
Author: Fan Yang     

## Objectives
Obtain total genomic DNA from environmental samples that are rich in inhibitors for sequencing (eg., soil and manure).   

## Materials    
1. Single-channel pipettemen
2. Autoclaved pipette tips and barrier pipette tips

## Procedures

**NOTE:**
+ Please wear gloves at all times.    
+ This SOP is for **a single sample extraction**. Adjust accordingly.    

### Detailed steps:  
- [ ] 1. Wipe your bench tip clean using 70% ethanol (EtOH).   
- [ ] 2. Direct subsample into the **PowerBead Tubes** provided (purple beat screw-capped 2ml tubes).    
    + See subsampling SOP for more details.    
- [ ] 3. Thaw **PowerBead Tubes** with samples if frozen. Invert several times to mix.    
- [ ] 4. Record the sample, your initial (eg. `FY`), and give the sample an extraction dummy number (eg. `1`) (if applicable)  in your notebook.   
    + For example, the sample you are extracting would be labeled as: FY1.   
- [ ] 5. Check **Solution C1**. If **Solution C1** is precipitated, heat solution to 60°C until
dissolved before use.    
- [ ] 6. Add 60 μl of **Solution C1** and invert several times or vortex briefly.
- [ ] 7. Secure **PowerBead Tubes** horizontally using the MO BIO Vortex Adapter
tube holder for the vortex. Vortex at maximum speed for 10 minutes.       
    + part No. MO BIO Catalog# 13000-V1-24 
    + **or**    
    + secure tubes horizontally on a flat-bed vortex pad with tape. Vortex at maximum speed for 10 minutes.   
    + **If you are using the 24 place Vortex Adapter for more than 12 preps, increase the vortex time by 5-10 minutes.**    
- [ ] 8. While waiting for **Step 7** to complete, take out 2 clean **2ml Collection Tube** (in the kit).    
    - [ ] 8.1. Label one tube with your initial, the extraction dummy number, and "C2" on the tube lid (eg. `FY1C2`).   
    - [ ] 8.2. Pipette 250 µl of **Solution C2** into the labeled tube (tube `FY1C2`).   
    - [ ] 8.3. Label the other tube with you initial, the extraction dummy number, and C3 on the tube lid (eg. `FY1C3`).   
    - [ ] 8.4. Pipette 200 µl of **Solution C3** into the labeled tube (tube `FY1C3`).  
- [ ] 9. Once **Step 7** is done, centrifuge tubes at 10,000 x g (RCF) for 1 minute at room temperature.   
    + Make sure the **PowerBead Tubes** rotate freely in your centrifuge without rubbing.    
    + Be sure not to exceed 10,000 x g (RCF) or tubes may break.    
- [ ] 10. Avoid the pellet, transfer the supernatant (up to 500 µl) to the tube from *Step 8.2** (eg., tube `FY1C2`).  
- [ ] 11. Vortex for 5 seconds.   
- [ ] 12. Incubate at 4ºC (put it in a tube holder in the fridge) for 5 minutes.  
- [ ] 13. While waiting for **Step 12** to complete, take out 1 clean **2ml Collection Tube**.   
    - [ ] 13.1 Label the tube with extraction dummy number and C4 on the tube lid (eg. `FY1C4`).   
    - [ ] 13.2 Pipette 2X 600 µl (total 1200 µl) of *Solution C4** into the labeled tube (tube `FY1C4`).   
- [ ] 14. Once **Step 12** is done, centrifuge the tubes at room temperature for 1 minute at 13,000 x g (RCF).    
- [ ] 15. Avoid the pellet, transfer the supernatant (up to 600 µl) to the tube from **Step 13.2** (eg., tube `FY1C3`).   
- [ ] 16. Vortex for 5 seconds.    
- [ ] 17. Incubate at 4ºC (put it in a tube holder in the fridge) for 5 minutes.   
- [ ] 18. While waiting for **Step 17** to complete, take out 1 **Spin Filter** (in the kit).   
    - [ ] 18.1 Label the **Spin Filter** with extraction dummy number (eg. `FY1`).   
- [ ] 19. Once **Step 17** is done, centrifuge the tubes at room temperature for 1 minute at 13,000 x g (RCF).    
- [ ] 20. Avoiding the pellet, transfer the supernatant (up to 750 μl) into the tube from **Step 13.2** (eg., tube `FY1C4`).    
    + The tube is going to be really full. Be careful!   
- [ ] 21. Invert the tube several times to mix.    
- [ ] 22. Lay down 2 pieces of paper towel (brown) on the bench top. Lay 2 pieces of KimWipe on top of the paper towel.    
- [ ] 23. Load 675 μl onto the labeled **Spin Filter** from **Step 18.1** (eg., spin filter `FY1`).   
- [ ] 24. Centrifuge at 11,000 x g (RCF) for 1 minute at room temperature.    
- [ ] 25. Once **Step 24** is done, take out the filter part of the **Spin Filter** (hold it in your hand). Dump out the liquid in the tube portion of the **Spin Filter** into a "temporary liquid waste" jar.   
- [ ] 26. While holding the filter in one hand and now the empty tube in the other, tap the tub on the KimWipe you layed down in **Step 22** to get rid of access liquid.    
- [ ] 27. Put the filter back into the same tub.   
- [ ] 28. Repeat **Step 23** to **Step 27** until the tube from **Step 20** (eg., tube `FY1C4`) is empty (3 times). 
- [ ] 29. After the last round of empty, pipette 500 µl of **Solution C5** into the same **Sping Filter** (eg., spin filter `FY1`).    
- [ ] 30. Centrifuge at room temperature for 1 minute at 11,000 x g (RCF).    
- [ ] 31. Discard the flow through.    
- [ ] 32. Centrifuge the same emptied **Spin Filter** (eg., spin filter `FY1`) at room temperature for 2 minute at 11,000 x g (RCR).    
- [ ] 33. Take a clean **2ml Collection Tube**. Label it (eg., `FY1`).    
- [ ] 34. Carefully place the filter portion in a clean **2ml Collection Tube** (in the kit). 
    + Avoid splashing any **Solution C5** onto the filter.   
- [ ] 35. Add 37 μl of **Solution C6** to the center of the white filter membrane. 
    + Use barrier tips.   
- [ ] 36. Let it sit for 1 minute.   
- [ ] 37. Centrifuge at room temperature at 11,000 x g (RCF) for 1 minute.  
- [ ] 38. Repeat **Step 35** to **Step 37** on the same filter and tube combination once.   
- [ ] 39. Discard the filter. Cap the tube. Store the tube in -80ºC freezer.    
- [ ] 40. Put the used **PowerBead Tube** in one of the bag in the **hazardous waste bin** the chemical hood.   
- [ ] 41. Discard the rest of the used tubes in trash.   
- [ ] 42. Wipe the bench top with 70% ethanol (EtOH) to clean.
