# So you've got your sequences back from ANL

## To do.

1.  Update the GERMS data management folder with depositing your raw sequencing data and also your mapped reads
   *Note that if you download from the link, it will be a zipped file*
   
2.  Demultiplex the sequencing reads based on the mapping file provided by ANL to get which samples belong to which sample IDs and consequently which project.
