#Purpose

This document explains the procedures to measure mcyA genes in lake water samples using a high-throughput real-time PCR system (i.e., Biomark HD).

# PPE

01. Gloves
02. Eye protection
03. Lab coat

# Materials

01. Lake water DNA samples
02. Primer sets targeting 16S rRNA and mcyA genes (forward and reverse combined, 100 uM each)
03. Flex Six Gene Expression IFC
04. Control line fluid for 96.96 IFC (2 syringes)
05. SsoFast Evagreen Supermix with Low ROX (2X, Bio-rad PN 1772-5211)
06. Flex Six Delta Gene Sample Reagent (Fluidigm PN 100-7673)
07. DNA suspension buffer (Teknova, 100217-094)
08. 2X Assay Loading Reagent (Fluidigm PN 100-5359)
09. Blank 96 well PCR plates
10. Pipettes (1000, 200, 10) and filtered tips
11. Sharpies
12. 70% ethanol

# Procedure:

Note: Thoroughly vortex and spin down plates before open those

00. Check the Biomark HD and the IFC controller HX are turned on
01. Ethanol and sterilize/prepare work station
02. Make 1/10 dilutions of DNA samples into a clean 96 well PCR plate (Skip this step if you already have done it.)
03. Using the included syringes, inject 150 μL of control line fluid into each accumulator.
04. Remove and discard blue protective film from bottom of IFC.
05. Place the IFC into the HX and run “Prime (153x)”. Note that the IFC needs to be loaded within 60 minutes of priming.
06. Prepare 10X assays for each primer sets. Our design is for four targets (one primer set for 16S rRNA genes and three primer sets for mcyA genes of different phylogenetic groups)
07. Prepare sample pre-mix. Pipet with care, because the Delta Gene Sample Reagent is
extremely viscous. Do not vortex the Delta Gene Sample
Reagent by itself at its stock concentration.
08. Load 3 ul of assay and sample mix into the IFC as planned. Our experimental design contains four sets of standard DNAs in 6 dilution factors and 48 samples.
09. Return the IFC to the HX machine and run “Load Mix (153x)”.
10. Double-click the Data Collection icon on the desktop.
11. Click Start a New Run.
12. Place the loaded IFC into Biomark HD and click load.
13. Select the partitions you wish to run. Need to choose all for our design.
14. Application type should be “Gene Expression”, Passive reference “ROX”, Assay “Single probe”, Probe type “EvaGreen”. Then click next.
15. Browse to and choose a thermal protocol: GE Flex Six Fast PCR+Melt v1
16. Confirm Auto Exposure is selected.
17. Click start run.
