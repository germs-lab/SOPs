## Preparing samples for Wafergen
Author: Lanying Ma

## Notes before you start:
1.	 We need to clarify several terms used in wafergen setting:
* Assay: primer sets.  The # of assays equals to (# of primer sets = # of targeted genes)* (# of replicates).
* Samples: will include standards (if you have any) in serial dilutions + negative controls + non-template control + your samples 
•	

## Protocol
1.	 The first and crucial step is to decide how many primer sets or how many samples you will send for wafergen. You have to know at least one of these two for sure, as you have to stick to certain layouts.  Based on the number of assays or the number of your samples, you can choose the best layouts to fit your experiment.  The available layouts are as follows: (eg. If you have 6 targeted gene with duplicates, it makes 12 essays)

Assays | Samples
----- | -----
12 | 384
24	| 216
36	| 144
48	| 108
54	| 96
72	| 72
80	| 64
96	| 54
120 | 42
144 | 36
216 | 24
248 | 20
296 | 16
384 | 12
2.	After you have decided the number of assays and/or the number of samples, contact Christi Harris, who takes charge of wafergen in MSU.
* The email address is: hemmingc@msu.edu
* She will send you the spreadsheet with suitable layout. 
*	In the layout, there is information of sample volume and volume of each primer set.
*	You always can email her with:
    *  A) what is the volume for each DNA sample?
    *	 B) what is the volume for each primer set?
    *  C) what is the volume for SYBR Mastermix?

*	For each layout, the volume of sample and volume of each primer set are different.  Please refer to the layout she sends you based on your experiment. 
*	Use 12 assays X 384 samples layout as an example:

3.	Measure the DNA concentration of your samples.
*	In a 96-well plate, normalize cDNA at 4-6ng/ul. Final reaction concentration will be 1 - 1.5ng/ul on the SmartChip.
*	If DNA concentrations are below the guidelines, they may not guarantee that they will work. However, they actually don’t know how low it could be. 
*	NO, it will not work if you want to put more volume to make up for low concentration of DNA.  Please give them the volume which they have asked you.

4.	Fill out the layout to indicate the samples and primers.
5.	Prepare sample plates and primer set plate. 
*	The initial concentration of primer sets is 100 uM and we have diluted primer sets to be 10 uM.  Use this 10 uM primer sets as the concentration for Wafergen use is normally 1 uM.((these primers are those which we don’t have standards for)) 
*	We have 8 plates of ARGs primer sets.  If you don’t have the spreadsheet of these primers, please talk to Lanying.
*	If you have lots of primer sets and want to use Robot to fill the primer set plates, Please talk to Lanying.
*	There is a paper in the box of primer sets where 16s primers in. Please write down the date of use and remaining volume.  As 16s primers are used almost for each run of Wafergen, to keep track of 16s primer will give us some idea of the volume of all other primers.
*	For these primers which we have standards for, for now, 16s, ermB, ermF, tetM. Please make the concentration to be 1um as required.  The way to make them:  the original synthetic primers are 100um. Add 10ul water to be 10 um. Then dilute them to be 1um as you needed taking into account of your needed volumn too.
*	For the standards, The synthetic DNA standards have mass on the tubes, first make it to be 10 ng/ul, then dilute it to be 1ng/ul. From here, 1 ul of this 1 ng/ul standards plus 36 ul water to make it be 1e8 copies/2ul concentration.  From here, you could make the series dilutions to get your desired standards. 


6.	You will need to send the Master Mix you want them to use, the DNA sample plates, and the Assay plate on dry ice.  The best way to seal the plate is with 8-strip caps. This seals the well individually so there should be no contamination between samples. 
7.	 To send out samples with dry ice, it is categorized as Hazardous Material Shipping, which is under strict regulation.  Please follow the next several steps.
*	Go to Hazardous Materials Shipping in Environment Health and Safety. https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/hazmat-ship
*	Click “online submission system” to go https://shipping.ehs.iastate.edu/user-index
*	Click “ Create New Shipment”, click “yes” to indicate there is dry ice in the parcel.
*	Put in the required information including “shipping data”, “contact”, etc. 
*	Submit to EH&S.
*	After approval, print it out to bring with you to the Chemistry Store.
    * This step is better to be done at least a day before your desired shipping date.
*	Go to AccessPlus then go Chemistry Store online, buy the dry ice.


8.	Bring your parcel with grant account number to Sylvia, ask her to print out the intermural for shipping parcel for Fedex.
9.	Go to Chemistry Store to get the dry ice in parcel.
10.	Go to “Postal & Parcel Servies” in General Business Building to send out parcels.
*	They only send out hazardous materials on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday every week.  Make sure you don’t miss these days.
*	It is better to send parcel to Wafergen at the beginning of week as they don’t work at weekend.
