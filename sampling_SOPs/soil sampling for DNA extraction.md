## Objectives   
General procedure of soil sampling for DNA extraction

### Things to consider before taking samples
1.	Make a plan for subsampling locations of each composite sample in the plot, distance from the edge and each subsampling location. Samplings should occur in the same pattern for each sampling event
2.	Decide the depth of sampling
3.	Whether baseline samples (soil and/or manure) should be included
4.	[Metadata](https://github.com/germs-lab/SOPs/blob/master/data_management_SOPs/GERMS_Lab_Data_Management_101.md) and sample ID (contact JiJY)
5.	Storage space and location (contact JiJY)
### Equipment
1.	Field maps or plot layout
2.	Soil probes, skinny tip marked at 6 inches, or depth desired for experiment
3.	Bucket â€“ one per sampler (for sampling into and mixing soil)
4.	Pre-label sample bags (small size ziplog bags or whirl-pack) and pre-organize according to sample sets or sampling plan
* Pre-label bags with permanent marker or waterproof address labels with laser printer (Avery 5520) before going into the field
* Labels should contain 
i.	Project name (and site names if more than one site)
ii.	Initials of a person who is responsible for samples
iii.	Unique sample ID (corresponds to metadata), easy to identify in the field is recommended
iv.	Date collected
+ for example: </br>
> LAMP / LM </br>
> M_2015_P3_N400</br>
> 04/25/18
5.	Coolers
6.	Dry ice or ice packs
7.	Gloves
8.	70% ethanol in spray bottles for sterilizing probe between samples
9.	Paper towels
10.	Extra sample bags
11.	Permanent marker
12.	Gallon-size freezer bag to organize samples for freezer storage

### Procedure
**Note** Gloves should be warned at all times
1.	Sterile soil probe and gloved hands with 70% ethanol then dry off with paper towels
2.	Collect samples by pushing soil probe into ground according to the desire depth and aggregate in a bucket
* Avoid collecting surface residue; remove obvious debris from bucket
* Push soil probe into ground firmly, but do not pound it in as this compacts soil.
* Invert soil probe over bucket.  If soil does not fall out easily, it may be necessary to gently hit probe on the edge of the bucket or use a sterile metal knife or screwdriver to remove soil from probe or ethanol sterile gloved hands.
* Repeat for each composite sample
3.	Homogenize soils in the bucket by shaking or missing with sterile metal spoon
4.	When soil is homogenized, pour about 30-50 grams of homogenized soil in pre-labeled sample bag. Release air in sample bags out before sealing.
5.	Place sample bags into a cooler that contains ice packs immediately
6.	Repeat step 1 to take sample in the next plot/treatment
7.	At the end of sampling, count to be sure all samples are present
8.	Store sample bags into gallon ziplog bags according to sample sets 
9.	Put samples into the freezer as soon as return to the lab
