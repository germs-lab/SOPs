## Objectives
Filter enviromental water sample prior to extract DNA

## Materials
1. Funnel

2. Waste flast and/or Vacuum manifold

3. Filter for sample

4. Another filter for middle of tubes 

5. Tubes

### Note
It is not easy to decide how much water you need to filter to get meaningful concentratino of DNA. If your water contains lots of sediment, 15-50 ml would be enough. However, if your water sample looks very clean even 500 ml would not enough. From my experience, in Iowa Lake sample, 500 ml would be good choice in most of time. 

## Procedures
1. Prepare autoclaved DI water for washing

2. Wash all equipment with ethanol

3. Set up funnel on the vacuum manufold

4. Rinse equipment with autocalved DI water

5. Put fileter on the vacuum funnel and assemble the funnel

6. Start vacuum

7. Pure water sample on the funnel

8. Take filter with forcep, role it sample side become inside

9. Put filter into 5 ml tube

10. Repeat step 2 to 9

10. Freeze 5 ml tube in -80C

11. Clean all equipmemt
