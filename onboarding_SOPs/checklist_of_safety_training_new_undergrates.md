## Training Checklist

## Background:
When new team member comes into our lab, there are several safety trainings that are required.  We also have "Site Specific Training". 

Here is a list of the required training:

* 1 Safety training online through learn@ISU
  * 1)	Fire Safety and Fire Extinguisher Training
  * 2)	Laboratory safety: Core concepts
  * 3)	Emergency Response Guide Video
  * 4)	Biosafety Cabinets: Safe Use and Maintenance
  * 5)	Biohazardous Materials: An Introduction
  * 6)	Autoclave Safety Training
  * 7)	Shop Safety Fundamentals -Basic procedures and Policies

* 2 Safety training on site
  * 1)	Site Specific Training: download from https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/forms/sstraining.pdf
  * 2)	There are four site specific forms under Google Drive/Adminstrational/Safety/Site_specific_forms, which are DNA_extraction_before_Robot, DNA_quantification_by_plate_reader, Robot_use_for_DNA_extraction, Water_filtering.  If you show your undergraduate any tricks, please fill out these forms and put them in our SOP folder in the lab and upload them in google drive. 

* 3 Lab Etiquette 101
   * 1) IF YOU DONâ€™T HAVE TIME TO CLEAN things because you have something else to do after experiments, DO NOT START IT. If you need to hurry things in the lab to meet the time, it is not helpful for your experiments at all.
   * 2) The autoclave and the dishwasher are public items. Pay extra attention to the rules. DO NOT LEAVE THINGS INSIDE OVERNIGHT. Run it when you can take them out as soon as possible.
   * 3) Please care about small, tiny rules you learned or people taught you. If you ignore small things, you may ignore big things later.
   * 4) If you are not sure about something (especially materials or reagents), find the right person and ask about it before use.
