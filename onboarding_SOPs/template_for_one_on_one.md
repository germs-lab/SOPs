Please spend 5-10 minutes answering the following questions and email them to me by 10 pm the night before your meeting.
If you are co-advised, please copy your other advisor also.

1.  What did you do this week?  (If you have results, you should put a link to a Box file with the data, code, and figures as appropriate.  It is helpful to have a powerpoint slides or some sort of presentation of the results to put on a screen for our discussion)

2.  What do you plan on doing next week?

3.  What were you struggling with this week?

4.  What would you like to discuss at our meeting?

5.  What are your writing goals this week?  (This should include a % completion goal and a deadline for yourself for being 100% complete.  This should also have a link to all completed parts of the writing.  If parts are complete for a paper, you should also note that it is done so I remember that you are not waiting on my feedback).  For example:  Introduction [Link] 100% complete; Methods [Link] 100% complete, waiting on your review; Results [30% complete, planned for completion on X/X/X].
