Thank you for asking me to be on your committee.

I have a couple general requests.  These are not rules but rather things you can discuss with other committee members and your advisor to help me best serve you.

*  Scheduling polls greater than three  choices are difficult for me to deal with.  I am happy to send my calendar to help you find times that work however!
*  Presentations longer than 60 minutes are unexpected to me and usually more than I can bear.

If you find these requests to be reasonable, I am happy to consider serving on your committee!

Thanks again for thinking of me!
