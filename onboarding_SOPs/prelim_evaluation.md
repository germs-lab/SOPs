Prelim Evaluation Questions
Discernment
•	You understand why you are pursuing a PhD (i.e. why are you here?)
•	You have a sense of professional direction (i.e. where are you going?)
•	You understand how your research fits in with the world, both practically and amongst other research.
•	You are able to identify key and answerable (probably) questions from the wide world of research topics related to your interests.
•	You are able to create a realistic but exciting scope for your research by generating specific and impactful objectives from the research questions.
•	You are able to determine how to go about answering those questions, and from the possibly numerous ways to go about that, you can identify the best way(s) – or at least defend the ways you select.
Analysis
•	You can apply appropriate (and creative, if the project hinges on technique development) techniques for answering your research questions.
•	You can present the results of those approaches in the most easily understandable way to address your questions directly.
•	You can recognize problems in your project, anomalies in your data, or unexpected results.
•	You can recognize expected results.
Evaluation
•	You can pull meaning from your results. 
•	You can use the implications of your results to build a strategy for moving forward (either for you to move forward in your project, or for somebody else to move forward where the movement would be outside the scope of your project).
Research Readiness
•	Motivation/background: what is the reason for your research? clear about why your research is important and valuable, and to whom.
•	Objectives: state them succinctly.
•	Impact: what will achievement of your objectives accomplish? How will it advance the science, and/or how will it have practical value?
•	Then, for each objective:
o	How you are going about achieving that objective. Methods match the objectives. The connection should be OBVIOUS rather than implied.
o	Your preliminary results – use graphic visual aids where appropriate.
o	The important conclusions you can draw from your work. Also note any conclusions that are perhaps not directly aligned with your objectives but are nonetheless significant.
o	Future work – what remains to be done before your objective is achieved?
