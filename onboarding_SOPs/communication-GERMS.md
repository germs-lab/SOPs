### Advice from Adina to manage Adina

### Know about my chaos

First, a brief glimpse into my day, I typically have 30-min to 2-h tasks or meetings scheduled in any day, meaning that I am trying to manage up to 10 major tasks a day, email, slack, and any spontaneous discussions that come up.  When you send me something, I usually prioritize your needs if I can (because I want to!).  That being said, I expect that when you choose to interact with me, you've thoughtfully considered that you would like my more immediate attention.

### Unscheduled communications (Slack, pop-in office) are definitely welcomed and can also be challenging for me.

Let me emphasize that I am here for you, and I love talking to you generally.  However, sometimes I am in jamming on something so well that I can't stop.  So, I as much as I love talking to you, it is realy helpful to be patient with my response.  Also, I really like it if you check in with me if its ok to interrupt.  For example, "Do you have a minute?"  Or, "when you have a minute, could I ask a question?"  is awesome. 

### Scheduled communications (Emails, Weeklys, Anything that I put on my calendar) are extremely important.

These are very important to me.  I consider it a privilage to have our team and to have you on our team. Thus, when we have these times, I try to focus on you or your task.  I also hope that you equally consider the same privilage and take that time to communicate to me your needs.  Some examples of great ways to so:

* On time deliverables 
* Organized communications or products.  The minutes saved searching for links in emails or in Box are welcomed!
* Thoughtfulness.  Updates on things I've asked you to do (without me asking), even if they are unfinished.  Make it easy for me to contribute in the most useful way.
* Accountability.  Remember, in the end, this journey is about you (and not me!). Whatever product you are producing, it is yours.  Think about professionalism in your communications with me and the team in associated communications on it.
