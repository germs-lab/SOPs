# Hazardous Shipping Protocol 

*	This SOP describes how to send samples with dry ice. We use this to mail, for example, DNA to Wafergen, Argonne (ANL) or JGI for sequencing.
*	**First time shipper** needs to take the Hazardous Materials Shipping Awareness course, available in the [Learn at ISU](https://training.ehs.iastate.edu/IowaSU/site/). Training must be updated every two years.
*	More information on off-campus shipping can be found at [Postal and Parcel Services](https://www.postal.iastate.edu/about/off-campus-shipping) website.

## Things to consider

*	Required documents may take a few days to be approved, it is advised to prepare and **have them ready one week before scheduled shipping date**.
*	Hazardous materials shipping is available Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday of each week. We typically plan to make shipments on Monday to avoid unexpected delay and delivery over the weekend. 
*	Package needs to be dropped off at Postal and Parcel Services before 3pm.
