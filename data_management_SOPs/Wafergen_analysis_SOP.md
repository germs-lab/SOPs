# Wafergen data is back, what next?

Once you get your Wafergen data back, you will need to process the data so that it is information.

The tutorial shown [here](http://germslab.org/wafergen/wafergenR.html) provides on information on:
- How to begin your data analysis in R, including making a standard curve
- Some analysis examples with data 
- Prerequisites:  Some chops on R, some installed packages such as ggplot2 and reshape2

# Practice with the toy dataset
- In the tutorial, there is a today dataset that you can work with, and run through the entire tutorial
- You should download the data for this tutorial first.  You can find that [here](https://github.com/germs-lab/wafergen-analysis-tutorial/tree/master/data)
- Next you'll need to modify the scripts, so that the location of your file is appropriate for your specific computer.
- From there, if you have the packages installed, you should be able to run through a sample analysis
- You can ask questions to our R-gurus if you have trouble.

# Keep improving our SOPs
