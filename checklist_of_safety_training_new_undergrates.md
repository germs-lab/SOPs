## Checklist to have new undergraduate into the lab
Written by Lanying Ma
## Background:
When new undergraduate comes into our lab, there are several safety trainings they have to do before they really start working.  
This year, there is one more training called Site Specific Training, which was brought up by E&HS staff when she did the safety
checking.  Without it, the EHS wonâ€™t complete our case of safety training in their system each year. Here I list all the safety
trainings to keep we all in loop.
* 1 Safety training online through learn@ISU
  * 1)	Fire Safety and Fire Extinguisher Training
  * 2)	Labortory safety:Core concepts
  * 3)	Emergency Response Guide Video
  * 4)	Biosafety Cabinets: Safe Use and Maintenance
  * 5)	Biohazardous Materials: An Introduction
  * 6)	Autoclave Safety Traning
  * 7)	Shop Safety Fundamentals -Basic procedures and Policies
* 2 Safety training on site
  * 1)	Site Specific Training: download from https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/forms/sstraining.pdf
  * 2)	There are four site specific forms under Google Drive/Adminstrational/Safety/Site_specific_forms, which are DNA_extraction_before_Robot, DNA_quantification_by_plate_reader, Robot_use_for_DNA_extraction, Water_filtering.  If you show your undergraduate any tricks, please fill out these forms and put them in our SOP folder in the lab and upload them in google drive.
